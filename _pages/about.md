I'm a four-year Ph.D candidate at [School of CS](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/main.htm). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhou](https://admis.fudan.edu.cn/sgzhou/main.htm) of ADMIS Lab from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/), Fudan University. Before that, I received my M.S. degree in Radio Physics at Xiamen University and my B.S. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at Nanchang University.

My research interests include computer vision, computer graphics, neural rendering, and image inpainting. Especially in the reconstruction of 3D faces and scenes using neural radiation fields and differentiable rendering methods based on physical information and graphical methods fused with artificial intelligence techniques.
I am open to possible collaboration or discussion opportunities. If you are interested in my research, please contact me via [Email](mailto:huangxl21@m.fudan.edu.cn)/ [Github](https://github.com/Youria1) /. You can find my CV here: [Huangxl's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/cv_hxl.pdf).


Research interests
======
*Multi-view face generation and self-attention mechanism;

*Physical-guide 3D faces and scenes Reconstruction; Neural radiance fields and differentiable rendering methods;

*The application of diffusion model and Gaussian splatting on image inpainting, object removal, and interference scene recovery.
