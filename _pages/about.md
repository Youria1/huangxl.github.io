I'm a third-year Ph.D candidate from [School of CS](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/main.htm). My research interests include computer vision, computer graphics, neural rendering, and image inpainting.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhou](https://admis.fudan.edu.cn/sgzhou/main.htm) of ADMIS Lab from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/), Fudan University. 

You can find my CV here: [XX's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
